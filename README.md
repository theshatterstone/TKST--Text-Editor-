# TKST--Text-Editor-
This is a Text Editor I'm working on using Python and Tkinter.

For anyone wondering, the name comes from a word play on 'text' and 'tk', because this is a text editor made uisng tkinter.
I'm doing this with the aim of learning some basic GUI programming. 

This code is likely going to be licenced under an open source licence, I just have to decide which one I'm going to use.
